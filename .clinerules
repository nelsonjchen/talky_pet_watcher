* This project uses bun, not npm or node.
* That means no ts-node or anything like that needed. Bun's got it all!
* The onvif stuff in npm is still in javascript and types don't seem to be available. OK, that sucks, but just work with it gradually.
* After major changes and before handing it back to the user, run the typecheck script to typecheck and fix all typing errors.
